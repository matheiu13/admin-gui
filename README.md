Hello I am Matheiu Perdido!
I am a fresh graduate from TIPQC and I am actively looking for a job.

The purpose of these repositories are for future references and personal projects, I highly advise anyone else
to not copy my work. I cannot guarantee you that my work would be compatible to your projects as I am making 
this with my own personal projects in mind but feel free to use it on your own projects but make sure to
edit it to for your own needs/wants.

If you have suggestions for my work here, you can always email me at matheiuamiel@gmail.com and maybe we can
collaborate.

lastly, updates of these repositories may not be frequent.
